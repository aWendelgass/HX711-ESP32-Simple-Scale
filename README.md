# HX711-ESP32-Simple-Scale
Simple project to test a scale based on the HX711. There are 3D print files for the scale. The sensors are placed in 3D printed feet. The HX711 is connected to the ESP32 via 2 GPIO. The SW calibrates the scales and then goes into weighing mode
Note: Apologies if the documentation and structure is not up to standard on Github. This is my first project on Github. I promise it will get better
